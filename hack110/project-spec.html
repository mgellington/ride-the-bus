// Title: Ride The Bus

// Description of Project: Based on a popular card-based drinking game, the objective of Ride The Bus is to guess the identity of four cards in a row based on a specific set of questions. 

// Team Members: Meredith Ellington

// COMP 110 concepts Used: Functions (to make the game progress), 2D Arrays (to build my deck of cards), arrays (to hold the identities of my current cards as the rounds progressed), classes (my cards class), for loops (to run through my arrays of cards), if/then statements (to compare the identiy of the card to the rules of the game), graphics and html (making the game more visual in nature--adding backgrounds, messages, message boxes, cards/sprites, etc.)

// Challenges Overcome/New Concepts Learned: Using Pixi.js, adding images as sprites, using arrays to save something's identity outside of a function, Math.random, and most importantly--how to not give up when a project gets challenging. My biggest challenge was being able to compare previous card values to current ones for rounds 2 and 3.

// Goals Achieved: Playing through all four rounds of the game, making graphics clickable, making pictures of cards appear on screen

// Goals Outstanding/Future Work: Possibly make the game multiplayer or make a more complicated version (but to be honest I got a lot further than I thought I would--I'm extremely proud of where it is now.)
